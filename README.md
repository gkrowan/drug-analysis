# Antidepressant Use in Children and Teens in Scandinavia

Antidepressants are a first-line treatment for children and teenagers suffering from a variety of mental health problems. Given their efficacy and low cost, some experts worry that antidepressents are overprescribed. This is particularly relevant in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, which have some of the highest rates of childhood antidepressant use in the world. This high use poses risks to young people, as antidepressants can cause rare but severe side effects in children and teens; side effects that are not present in adult users. The causes of side effects in young people are not well understood, indicating the need for more rigorous research into the impact of these medications on vulnerable populations.

In this project, I seek to better understand the rates of antidepressant prescription among young people in Scandinavia. Can it be determined through existing literature and data whether the trends in antidepressant usage in young people in these countries are cause for concern, especially regarding first-line versus second- and third-line treatments? How do these trends vary by country, age group, and type of antidepressant prescribed?
