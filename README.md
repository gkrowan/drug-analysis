**Antidepressant Use in Children and Teens in Scandinavia**

Anitdepressants are a first-line treatment for children and teenagers suffering from a variety of mental health problems. Given their generally low cost, some worry that antidepressents are overprescribed or incorrectly prescribed in cases where other treatments for mental health disorders may be more effective. This is particularly relevant in Scandinavia, which has some of the highest rates of antidepressant use in the world. This poses risks to young people, as antidepressant use can cause rare but severe side effects in children and teens, side effects that are not present in adult users. The causes of side effects in young people are not well understood, indicating the need for more rigorous research into the impact of these medications on vulnerable populations.

In this project, I seek to better understand the rates of antidepressant prescription among young people in Scandinavia. Can it be determined through existing literature and the data whether the trends in antidepressant usage in young people in these countries are cause for concern, especially regarding first-line versus second- and third-line treatments? How do these trends vary by country, age group, and type of antidepressant prescribed?
